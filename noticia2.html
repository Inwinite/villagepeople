      <h2>Cantante original de Village People es respaldado por el sindicato de Autores</h2>

      <p>Victor Willis, the lead singer of the Village People, just gained a powerful ally: the Songwriter Guild of America, who have backed his legal efforts to regain control over his share of the copyright credit for dozens of the band’s songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In April, Willis filed court papers to secure credit for 32 of the Village People’s songs – including the hit “Y.M.C.A.” – based on a rarely cited 1978 revision to copyright law that enables “termination rights” for artists, meaning they can reclaim copyright
        grants 35 years after a song is published. Willis filed against Scorpio Music and Can't Stop Productions, who have refuted him by maintaining that they hired the frontman on a work-for-hire basis and that he never owned the songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, now that the Songwriter Guild has backed Willis, the singer has a more solid case. In their legal brief, the guild maintained that the publishing companies in question are merely attempting to snare Willis in a long, costly legal battle that
        will dissuade him from securing his rightful ownership. “It is a simple fact that authors of copyrighted works have limited financial – and therefore limited legal resources,” they wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
        The publishing companies attempted to stop the guild from filing the brief, but this week, a district judge in California allowed the filing. According to The New York Times, Judge Barry T. Moskowitz accepted the guild’s participation because it could
        set a precedent for future artists seeking copyright ownership through the 1978 revision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Willis is not the first songwriter to request control of his prior work: Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty are also currently seeking ownership of past music, as well. However, the fact that Willis was employed by a publishing company at the
        time of writing does differentiate his case from those of independent artists, and will quite possibly set the standard for all hired songwriters to come.
